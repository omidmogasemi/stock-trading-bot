next iteration needs to utilize bracket orders, and take a ticker off the watchlist
while an order is being held, and then add it back once it has been taken off of the portfolio
which thus must be checked at the top of each minute-by-minute iteration.
i also need to develop an inner-algo algorithm to find a SL and TP when a buy decision is made
also look into their order update websocket stuff because that will significantly make this project much easier
